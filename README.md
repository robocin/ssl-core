# ssl-core

This repository contains Rob√¥CIn's next yet-to-be-developed software for the RoboCup Small Size Soccer.

Its conception consists of a long-term project that tries to apply the concept of microservices to robotics, taking the utmost care to meet the latency and resource management requirements that exist in the category, exploring the single responsibility principle so that each service has an isolated purpose.

## About

The `ssl-core` project is organized as a language-agnostic monorepo package-by-feature microservices. Top-level directories contains its own `README.md` and are individually responsible for describing its purpose.

## System Requirements

All the code developed was done in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) with development tied to a [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), making it platform-independent.

## Codemap

  Contains experiments and prototypes for conceptual validation.
* [`vision-be`](vision-be/README.md)

  Contains the vision microservice.
* [`common`](common/README.md)
